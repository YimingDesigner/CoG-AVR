# CoG-AVR

## Overview

Too many wires and utilities are required to flash a microcontroller, which not meets the elegant and minimalism taste of AVR chip.

Here we designed a minimam development board to flash programs to 4 pin AVR microcontrollers, accompanied with a utility called USBtiny. One with `SOIC` package can also be flashed using IC sockets.
